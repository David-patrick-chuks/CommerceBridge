### Core Functions

#### `handleSupportQuestion(userQuestion, userType, userPhone)`
Generates AI responses to support questions.

```typescript
const response = await handleSupportQuestion(
  "How do I create an account?",
  "customer",
  "+1234567890"
);
```

#### `shouldEscalateToHuman(userQuestion, userType)`

```typescript
const shouldEscalate = await shouldEscalateToHuman(
  "My payment failed!",
  "customer"
);
```

### Session States

The system uses these session states to manage support interactions:
