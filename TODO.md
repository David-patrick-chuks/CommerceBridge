# CommerceBridge - Development Roadmap & TODO

## üéØ Project Overview
CommerceBridge is a **WhatsApp-first e-commerce platform** where customers and sellers interact entirely through a smart chatbot interface. The bot serves as the middleman, handling all transactions and communications without direct contact between customers and sellers.

**Core Concept**: Everything happens in WhatsApp - browsing products, ordering, payments, seller management - except account creation which uses a web link.
