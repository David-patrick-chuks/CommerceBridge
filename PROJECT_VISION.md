- **Search and filter** products through conversation
- **Add to cart** and manage orders via WhatsApp

- **Get support** without leaving WhatsApp

### For Sellers:
- **Upload products** by sending photos and details to the bot
- **Manage inventory** through WhatsApp messages
- **Track sales** and analytics via chat
- **Handle orders** and customer inquiries
- **Receive payments** automatically
